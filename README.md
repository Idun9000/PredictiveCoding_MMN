## Title of paper
Predictive Coding and Multisensory Integration: Investigating Cross-Modal Mismatch Negativities - An EEG pilot study

## Hypotheses investigated
**H.1:** Cross-modal deviances will result in a stronger MMN response than unimodal deviances indicated by higher negative peak amplitude

From H.1 two supporting hypotheses are presented: 

**H.1.1:** The visual MMN response will be stronger for audiovisual deviances than for visual deviances

**H.1.2:** The auditory MMN response will be stronger for audiovisual deviances than for auditory deviances
